## Siralim Planner by Berated Bert

This is a fan-made tool designed to simplify the process of planning builds for [Siralim Ultimate](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289810/Siralim_Ultimate/). As a longtime fan of the series I always wished there was an easy way to theorycraft Siralim builds - so I came up with this tool. The three main features of this tool are outlined below.

### Party Planner

The Party Planner allows you to put together a list of 18 traits for your Siralim Ultimate party. It is comprised of 18 rows, which are separated into 6 groups of 3 - these correspond to your party members, and their 3 traits (2 creature traits, and 1 artifact slot).

To start planning your party, click on one of the 18 rows. This brings up the Trait Selection Window, described below.

You can **drag and drop** traits between rows to swap them - this enables you to easily swap traits between creatures/slots.

The tool also supports some basic **validation**: if you put a trait from a monster that cannot be obtained (i.e. a Nether Boss) into a creature slot, the row will be highlighted with red stripes to let you know that such an assignment is not possible.

### Trait Selection Window

In the trait selection window, you can **search** for a particular keyword, e.g. if you want to find all creatures that interact with buffs in some way you can type "buff" and the results will be filtered accordingly.

### Sharing builds

Builds can be easily shared - simply copy the URL and send it to someone and they will be able to load your build.

### Acknowledgements and Source Code

The data was sourced from the [Siralim Ultimate Compendium](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qvWwf1fNB5jN8bJ8dFGAVzC7scgDCoBO-hglwjTT4iY/edit#gid=0), a fantastic resource by EmptyPalms. I'd like to thank EmptyPalms for putting together this resource and for their permission to use the data as part of this tool. I would also like to thank rogermicroger for their excellent [Siralim Ultimate API](https://github.com/rovermicrover/siralim-ultimate-api), from which the creature sprites and stats are obtained.

The **source code** of this tool is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/berated-bert/siralim-planner). If you would like to work on it you are more than welcome to submit a pull request or fork the repository.

Depending on usage I may or may not keep the tool up-to-date with the latest version of the Siralim Ultimate Compendium. If it is not up-to-date at some point feel free to download the code yourself and run it locally. Better yet, feel free to update the GitHub repository with the latest spreadsheet and submit a pull request.

If you encounter any problems or have any feedback please feel free to message me on Discord - **BeratedBert#6292**, or submit an issue on the GitHub repo.
