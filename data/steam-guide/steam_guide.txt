Hell Knight

Careful planning and uptight caution are nothing but a cause to doubt oneself. Hell Knights realize this fact, and instead opt to send their creatures charging headlong into battle, relying on brute strength and reckless attacks to ensure a swift victory.

As a Hell Knight, you'll favor creatures that specialize in attacking. Hell Knights grant their creatures increased critical damage and cause a variety of effects to occur when they attack. Hell Knights are surprisingly adept at spellcasting in a pinch, as well.

Notes
Hell Knights are the specialization with the hardest focus on physical attacks, and they have a handful of other tricks just in case that attack strategies get shut down by enemies - though due to perks like Deadly Calm, Dreadnaught, and Indomitable, you will likely encounter these situations less often than other specializations would.

Getting the most out of this specialization will involve finding creatures that enhance your attacks further, finding ways to use on-hit effects and also launch extra attacks. The Asura Heartripper you are given to start with gets four attacks per turn - your Pyromania and Touch of Chaos perks will be far more likely to trigger in synergy with four hits. In addition it hits fairly hard, and your other perks will only make this damage even stronger.

Hell Knights also have a smaller focus on the Burning debuff, so finding creatures that can use Burning in various ways will benefit you - especially with the Kindling perk that will make your first monster set all enemies on fire at the beginning of each battle. This is also a great way to still damage monsters that have found a way to stop you from attacking or punish you if you do.

Hell Knight anointments can be obtained by defeating Nebodar.
Reaver

Perseverance, an iron will, and a touch of insanity are the perfect recipe for victory. Reavers live and die by this mantra, instilling their creatures with a cold and calculated anger that allows them to grow more powerful during battle while their foes tire out.

As a Reaver, your creatures will gain massive benefits in combat as battle continue to drag on. If your creatures manage to survive for just a few extra turns, they'll be able to devastate your enemies.

Notes
An interesting specialization with mechanics that almost nothing else in the game uses, Reavers don't just get stronger as battles wear on, but actually grow stronger from winning prior battles within a realm too using the Reign of Chaos and Onslaught perks. Once you've got a few victories going within a realm, you should find yourself increasingly steamrolling battles - and for those you still find tricky, you can always just hunker down for a few turns, wait for your strength to gather, and then lash out with far more power than you started with.

Reavers are also unique in that they can not just immunize themselves against battle fatigue using Stimulation, but actually thrive off it with Sap. This makes them without peer when it comes to attrition tactics - which, using Rapid Exhaustion and Red-Eye Flight, sets in far sooner than it does for other specializations.

Almost all creatures will benefit from Reaver's perk set, but finding creatures that grow increasingly more powerful as time goes on will have the effects of their traits amplified even further - the Apocalypse you are given to start with gets more powerful the more turns it takes for example, and its somewhat tank-ish stats allow it to last long enough to ensure this happens.

Reaver anointments can be obtained by defeating Loid Prime.
Pyromancer

Pyromancers quite literally thrive on watching the world burn. These maniacal magi ignite both friend and foe alike with a brilliant conflagration, causing their enemies to suffer gruesome deaths while empowering their allies with the power of flame.

As a Pyromancer, you'll make heavy use of the Burning debuff to deal damage to enemies over time. In addition, your own creatures will be afflicted with this debuff, but it will heal and empower them rather than dealing damage.

Supplemental Info
Status Effects
Burning (All Perks)
Creatures with Burning take damage based on the inflictor's Intelligence each turn.

Scorned (Backdraft)
Creatures with Scorned cannot attack. Overwrites Silenced. Creatures that are resistant to Scorned can still attack, but deal 50% less damage with attacks.

At the start of a creature's turn, its Bomb detonates, dealing damage to the creature equal to 80% of the afflictor's Speed. Then, this debuff is removed.

Notes
The Burning debuff runs off the inflictor's Intelligence, so to get the most effect out of this specialization you will want a casting team with high Intelligence stats - in addition, perks such as Kindle the Flame and Pyroblast do suggest using a team of casters to take full advantage.

Beyond that, your entire playbook revolves around the Burning debuff and it causing a ton of extra effects - find creatures that interact with Burning or debuffs in general and you'll get more out of this specialization. Keep an eye out for creatures that are immune to debuffs, but the amount of power you wield means you'll not have too much trouble with them once their allies are gone.

Pyromancer anointments can be obtained by defeating Nebodar.
Necromancer

Necromancers prefer to overwhelm their foes by summoning minions to aid their creatures in battle. Enemies are often so perplexed by the number of undead monstrosities charging at them from across the battlefield that they're dead long before they realize what even happened.

As a Necromancer, you'll summon minions to aid your creatures in battle. These minions can do all kinds of things to support your creatures - they can cause damage, boost your creatures' stats, debuff enemies, and much more.

Notes
Minions are essentially a special type of buff that offer specific enhancements to creatures that control them, but wear off more quickly - usually after performing their function. Necromancers mitigate this flaw by keeping minions around longer using perks like Army of the Damned, Undying Loyalty and Midnight Bargain. They're also much more adept at calling minions forth than other specializations, with a wide array of perks that summon up new ones.

In addition, they get stronger simply from having minions around - Meat Shield and Servitude stack up to offer power beyond what just the minions in and of themselves offer, which is usually considerable to begin with. They can also summon up the Four Horsemen much more easily, and if they get all four, they will start to snowball the battle in your favor by healing your own team and damaging the enemy team repeatedly.

The Dread Hound you begin with starts with and maintains a stack of Dire Wolves, a minion that enhances its master's attack power. Leverage this using your perks and other creatures that synergize with minion use to start battles with a great deal of immediate strength.

Necromancer anointments can be obtained by defeating Loid Prime.
Defiler

The difference between good and evil is often a matter of perspective, but the morality of a Defiler is simple enough for anyone to decide. These dark magi take sadistic pleasure in afflicting their adversaries with crippling diseases, reducing them to weakened husks that no longer have the capacity to defend themselves.

As a Defiler, you'll specialize in debuffs and stat-reducing effects. Enemies will be so weak that your party will be able to easily pick them off, even if they were originally much more powerful than your creatures.

Feared (Horror Show)

Vulnerable (Tenderness)
Vulnerable creatures take 50% more damage.

Notes
Rather than making your own creatures stronger with perks like most classes, the Defiler chooses instead to weaken enemies and take away options they may have of defending themselves from you. The Curse perks knock out a significant chunk of enemy stats, so they'll be operating below their true capacity right from the start of battle - and perks like Tragedy, Hopelessness and Blasphemy limit the enemies options in recovering from or mitigating the weakening effects you heap upon them.

An important synergy Defiler has is with debuffs - while their effects are often debilitating to begin with, Defilers take this to another level entirely by ensuring they stick around longer, weaken them further, and with perks like Wane and Unholy Night, just cause direct damage simply by applying them.

The Dread Spectre you begin with needs to be attacked by enemies to leverage its weakening effect, but with your perk set the enemies will be hitting for rather feeble amounts of damage, so this is much less disadvantageous than it would otherwise be. If you can find creatures that apply or use debuffs to their advantage, they will synergize well with Defiler's perk set and weaken enemies even futher.

Defiler anointments can be obtained by defeating Loid Prime.
Animator

There's a fine line between genius and insanity, and it's difficult to say on what side of that line Animators reside. These fanatical magi spend their days perfecting their Animatus creations: unique creatures that grow more powerful as their master's dark experiments unveil new opportunities.

As an Animator, you will always have a unique creature in your party called an Animatus. Your entire battle strategy will likely focus on this creature. You can empower your Animatus, and even use your other creatures to make it stronger in combat.

Status Effects

Animated Gem (Dark Anima)
After the Animated Gem's master manually casts a spell, this minion casts one of its master's Spell Gems as well, chosen randomly.

Notes
For Animators, everything hinges around the Animatus - every single perk they have relates to it and enhances it in a broad variety of ways. Some of them such as Cogmind or Molecular Betrayal even weaken your other creatures to strengthen the Animatus even further. Perks that do not relate to the other members of your party strengthen the Animatus in other ways, such as Dancing Blade and Dark Anima making its equipment more powerful, and Desensitization and Forbidden Magic giving it defensive options.

It's a rather all-in strategy and a dark counterpart to the Druid, and your other creatures will find little benefit from the perk set, so try to find creatures that complement the Animatus's strength using the perks that affect creatures within certain positions of the party.

Animator has no anointments that can be equipped by other specializations.
Bloodmage

The Blood Mage is a deranged spellcaster who is willing to do anything to overcome his foes - even at the cost of his own creatures' lives. This menacing spellcaster is adept at manipulating the lifeforce of allies and foes alike in his endless pursuit for power.

As a Blood Mage, your creatures will grow more powerful as they take damage. To facilitate these effects, the Blood Mage offers a variety of different ways to inflict damage on his own creatures.

Bleeding (Bloody Massacre)
Creatures with Bleeding take damage equal to 30% of their current Health at the start of each turn. Creatures that are resistant to Bleeding take 66% less damage from this debuff.

Notes
At first, Blood Mage seems like a high-risk high-reward class since it offers a lot of power in exchange for taking damage or being on low health, but perks such as Hemostasis and Sanguine Fortitude mitigate that risk considerably, giving Blood Mages an array of both offensive and defensive options.

In addition, since Blood Mages thrive off damage taken with perks such as Blood-Caked Blade and Sanguine Fortitude, they have a degree of resistance to battle attrition and will get stronger as the battle continues, though not to the same extent as Reavers. They can also synergize highly with the Bleed status effect since it will always be applied to enemies.

Bloodmage anointments can be obtained by defeating The Ancestor.
Cleric

The best offense, as some say, is a good defense. Clerics protect their creatures with powerful healing abilities and steadfast barriers, ensuring that not even the most tenacious of foes can overcome them.

As a Cleric, you'll specialize in healing abilities, as well as buffing, resurrection, stat-boosting effects, and providing your creatures with protective barriers. Your creatures will be extremely difficult to kill.

Status Effects
Blighted (Consecrated Ground)
Creatures with Blighted cannot be healed and take damage from healing effects equal to 25% of the effect.

Barrier (Guiding Light, Luminesce, Premonition, Saving Grace, Strength of Soul)
Barrier absorbs a certain amount of damage. After the maximum amount of damage is dealt, the buff is removed. Barrier strength cannot exceed 200% of a creature's Maximum Health.

Notes
By far the most defensive specialization, Cleric revolves all around making it ridiculously hard for your creatures to be brought down. A great deal of Cleric's perk set revolves around Barriers, which are essentially an extra health pool over the top of your main health pool which is depleted first before your actual health. Guiding Light, Luminesce and Saving Grace will allow you to put up and maintain barriers, while Premonition and Strength of Soul make your creatures stronger while they have them.

Outside of barriers, Clerics still have a lot of strong defensive options - Guardian Angel and Lenience mitigate incoming damage, whereas Greater Healing and Revelation ensure that any damage that does get through is quickly reversed. A notable gap in the Cleric's defensive arsenal is a lack of protection from debuffs, so it may be a good idea to find spells and traits that cover this weakness.

You start with a Unicorn Holycaster, another member of the Unicorn race - this one heals rather than revives, so the two can keep each other alive in different ways. Clerics get a lot out of healing and buffing, so try to find creatures that can apply or strengthen buffs or throw good heals around to get the most out of your perks.

Cleric anointments can be obtained by defeating Saint Althea.
Inquisitor

Burn the witch, judge the heretic, and slay the non-believer. Inquisitors make use of healing effects just as much for offense as they do for defense. They enact justice on behalf of the gods, and no one will be spared from holy rapture.

As an Inquisitor, you'll have a solution at your disposal for every problem you encounter. In addition, Inquisitors are able ot use healing effects for offensive purposes - for example, when your creatures heal enemies, they instead cause damage to them.

Vulnerable (Condemn)
Vulnerable creatures take 50% more damage.

Feared (Rebuke)
Feared creatures cannot gain stats.

Rebirth (Shining Force)
Creatures with Rebirth are resurrected with 50% Health when they die.

Notes
Inquisitor is something of an inverse of the Cleric - rather than using healing to augment their defenses, Inquisitors gain more offensive power as a result. In addition, many of their perks such as Admonish, Berate, Castigate, Condemn and Rebuke attempt to target specific weaknesses of classes to limit their available strategies.

Among their mixed options, Inquisitors also have something of an adaptive countering strategy, with Begrudge and Judgment trying to shut down enemy casters, and Contrition countering attackers. Divine Strength and Miracle use your defensive options by enhancing your damage output, and Flagellation allows you to outright weaponize heals by making them harm enemies.

The Valkyrie Scout you begin with counterattacks any time any enemy attacks, which will give you an edge especially if you synergize it with your anti-mage options. Beyond this, Inquisitors want to find creatures that can perform heals to get the most out of their perks, though since a lot of their perks weaken enemies rather than strengthen monsters, it isn't quite as paramount as it is with other specializations.

Inquisitor anointments can be obtained by defeating The Ancestor.
Monk

A strong defense is unnecessary when your foe is unable to strike you in the first place. Monks grant their creatures unmatched agility, enabling them to dodge incoming attacks and spells, and respond with devastating counter-attacks.

As a Monk, you'll boost your creatures' chance to Dodge attacks and spells. When your creatures Dodge, they'll unleash a devastating counter-attack on the enemy.

Your creatures have a 5% chance (up to 80%) to avoid damage for each time all your creatures dodged in the current battle.

Supplemental Info
Status Effects
Agile (Good Karma)
Creatures with Agile have an additional, independent chance to dodge attacks.

Notes
Similar to the Paladin, the Monk revolves around using enemy attacks to launch counterattacks - but where the Paladin takes the hits that come their way, the Monk simply avoids them outright. Many of their perks such as Good Karma, Serenity, and Protective Winds increase the chance to dodge incoming damage, and then Celerity is used to offer counterattacks.

Celerity is a key perk since a number of others work off it - Blurred Strikes, Extended Reach, Pressure Point and Vital Strike all require Celerity to work, so strongly consider unlocking Celerity first. The order you want to unlock things in depends on whether you want to prioritize mitigating damage or dealing it back out, so think carefully about which perk you want to take next.

The Summer Aspect is a creature that has significantly large chance on its own to dodge attacks even before its considerable speed is factored in, playing into the Monk's perk set perfectly. Outside of this one, you may want to seek out other creatures with high speed and dodge-related effects to get the most out of your perks.

Monk anointments can be obtained by defeating Jotun.
Warden

Wardens are wholly attuned to the needs of their creatures. These powerful magi empower their creatures with various boons to give them an edge over their opponents in battle.

Notes
Wardens are all about buffs - gaining pairs of them for particular actions or events, leading to them rather quickly stacking up a large amount of buffs. If you can find creatures that share buffs around, your whole team will suddenly be very stacked up - and there are all sorts of creatures in the game that synergize with buffs in general or specific kinds of buffs to power them up further, so there's a lot to choose from to synergize with this perk set.

Do note that since the buffs are granted reflexively, you won't start battles at full power unless you pull a extra tricks with your team composition.

Warden anointments can be obtained by defeating Jotun.
Witch Doctor

Witch Doctors are spiritual warriors who cast deadly hexes and curses on their enemies, forcing them to fight against each other.

Doppelganger (Vision Quest)
The Doppelganger's master has a 25% chance to take an extra turn.

Notes
Witch Doctors rely on getting the enemy to defeat themselves by causing them to damage each other more often, and make it much more debilitating when they do so. Perks like Bewitch, Maledict and Terrorize also cause somewhat of a cascading effect so that as the battle goes on, the enemy will cause additional attrition to themselves.

The perk set has a rather full reliance on this strategy however, and lacks options other than tricking the enemy - so beware situations where you may not have access to your usual tools, such as being blocked from inflicting debuffs or casting spells easily.

Witch Doctor anointments can be obtained by defeating Jotun.
Evoker

Evokers are the ultimate spellcasters. They excel at casting enhanced versions of spells multiple times in a row to overwhelm their enemies before they can act.

As an Evoker, you'll empower your creatures' spellcasting capabilities. Your creatures will be able to cast the same spell multiple times in one turn, and these spells will be much stronger than if they had cast them without your guidance.

Target takes a small amount of damage.

Status Effects
Silenced (Outspoken)
Creatures with Silenced cannot cast spells. Overwrites Scorned. Creatures that are resistant to Silenced can still cast spells, but deal 50% less damage with spells.

Notes
Evoker does two particular things very well - offensive versatility, and sheer attack power. With almost no defensive options other than Outspoken (which, make no mistake, is a very important perk for such a magic-heavy specialization), Evokers go all-in on magical attacks with perks like Echo and Mirror Image allowing spells to be cast multiple times in the same turn, then Spell Power and Arcane Power making those casts hit even harder.

An important perk to take note of is Efficiency - without this perk, Echo/Mirror Image will very quickly make you run out of charges, leaving you with your main form of attack depleted. Meanwhile, the five Mastery perks allow free equipping of any class of spell gem on any class of creature, which gives you drastically more options in what spells you can bring and who to equip them on.

The Spider Occultist has excellent caster stats, and joins in with a magic attack any time one of its allies casts a spell - due to Echo and Mirror Image, this attack itself will often be repeated several times. If you can find creatures that synergize well with spellcasting, you will do tremendously well as an Evoker.

Evoker anointments can be obtained by defeating Caliban the Unredeemed.
Cabalist

Cabalists can conjure Spell Gems out of thin air to be used by their creatures at any given moment. These magi prefer to employ high-risk, high-reward battle strategies to ensure their victory.

As a Cabalist, you'll enable your creatures to cast spells that they normally wouldn't have access to. While other people's creatures might run out of Spell Gem Charges, you'll be able to keep your creatures well-stocked with fresh Spell Gems at the start of every battle.

After the Animated Gem's master manually casts a spell, this minion casts one of its master's Spell Gems as well, chosen randomly.

Arcane (Flow of Magic)
When an Arcane creature casts a spell, the spell does not consume any Charges. Then, this buff is removed.

Silenced (Unshackled)
Creatures with Silenced cannot cast spells. Overwrites Scorned. Creatures that are resistant to Silenced can still cast spells, but deal 50% less damage with spells.

Notes
Cabalists are somewhat unpredictable, but similar to Reavers will grow stronger as the battle carries on. Wild Magic and Invoke give your creatures random new spells during every battle, so you'll quickly find yourself becoming familiar with figuring out how to use what you've been provided with to your advantage.

On top of this, Evokers gain strength from the spells they're given in battle, with perks like Culmination, Hand of the Magi and Spellslinger synergizing with the amount of Ethereal gems you'll accumulate during battle to give you more power. If you can find spells or creatures that grant you even more spell gems, you'll get drastically stronger and stronger as the battle continues, though beware of strategies that disrupt or prey upon ethereal gem use.

You begin with a Djinn Dreamweaver, a powerful caster that uses an extra, random spell any time it casts a spell manually. This can have all manner of unpredictable effects, so be prepared for anything that might come of this.

Cabalist anointments can be obtained by defeating Mindwurm.
Sorcerer

Sorcerers are masters of controlling the battlefield. Why worry about offense or defense when your enemies can't move to begin with?

As a Sorcerer, you'll support your creatures by debilitating their enemies from afar. Generally, your enemies won't be able to act for the first few turns in battle as long as you're around.

Supplemental Info
Status Effects
Frozen (Frostbite Yeti, Deep Freeze, Spell of Frost)
Frozen creatures are unable to act until they thaw, and have a 25% chance to thaw at the start of their turn. This chance doubles after each of their turns. Creatures that are resistant to Frozen have double the chance to thaw.

Invisible (Fade)
Invisible creatures cannot be targeted by enemy attacks or spells.

Creatures with Scorned cannot attack. Overwrites Silenced. Creatures that are resistant to Scorned can still attack, but deal 50% less damage with attacks.

Snared (Spell of Roots)
Creatures with Snared are stuck at the bottom of the Timeline until they break free. They have a 10% chance to break free at the start of each creature's turn. Creatures that are resistant to Snared have triple the chance to break out of this debuff.

Sleeping (Spell of Slumber)
Creatures with Sleeping cannot act until they either take damage or this debuff wears off. Creatures that are resistant to Sleeping wake up at the start of their turns.

Notes
Using ridiculous amounts of trickery to completely shut down their foes, Sorcerers would no doubt be infuriating to fight against if they were opponents. The three Spell perks, Deep Freeze, Psychic Scream, Flabbergast and Singe all attempt to prevent opponents from taking actions at all, while others like Mental Fortitude and Fade allow your creatures to avoid certain enemy actions outright.

Other perks such as Gravity's Void and Solidarity enhance the Sorcerer's damage output in esoteric ways, though if your opponents have been shut down, then you'll have plenty of time to take your opponents out without them being able to retaliate at all.

The Frostbite Yeti that Sorcerers start with has very strong defenses and is able to freeze enemies, allowing you plenty of time to set up your strategy. Sorcerers synergize well with creatures that use or inflict debuffs, but given how many perks affect the enemy rather than your own team, it shouldn't be too hard to get most teams to synergize well with Sorcerer's perk set.

Sorcerer anointments can be obtained by defeating Mindwurm.
Paladin

Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. Paladins are patient combatants who prefer to allow their enemies to strike first, and then return the favor tenfold with holy fury.

As a Paladin, your creatures will be able to endure even the most powerful of attacks. Each time your creatures take damage, they'll also damage their enemies.

This is an Advanced specialization and as such cannot be chosen at the beginning, nor does it get a starter creature.

After your creatures deal damage with Retribution, they Cast Holy Smite on the enemy as well.

Supplemental Info
Spells
Holy Smite (Divine Toll)
Target takes a small amount of damage and the caster recovers a small amount of Health.

Notes
Paladins are a heavily counterattack based class, who do a great deal of their damage simply by responding to incoming damage. The notable core perk is Retribution, which many of the Paladin's other perks work off of, so strongly consider unlocking some ranks in Retribution as your first pick.

After this, there are quite a number of ways that Retribution can be enhanced further - Art of War, Crusade, Wrath and Zeal all increase the damage Retribution does in various ways, whereas Glory and Hand of Light will strengthen the creature each time Retribution is used. Outside of this perk, the Paladin has a lot of defensive options such as Light's Augmentation, Perseverance, and Seraphim. So not only will your team be hard to kill, but enemies are likely to destroy themselves in the process of trying to bring you down.

Paladin anointments can be obtained by defeating Saint Althea.
Druid

Many people foolishly mistake a Druid's introversion for weakness. These magi believe that quality always trumps quantity on the battlefield. Contrary to tradition, they are often seen with fewer than six creatures at their disposal, but the havoc their limited numbers wreak when augmented by Druidic magic is a sight to behold.

As a Druid, you'll probably only want to have one (or up to three, later on) creatures in your party. Your creatures will gain massive benefits for being part of a smaller party.

This is an Advanced specialization and as such cannot be chosen at the beginning, nor does it get a starter creature.

Notes
Druids get stronger the less creatures they bring with them, with maximum synergy achieved when you have only one creature with you. Outside of the Companion perk, every perk the Druid has relates to benefiting from not bringing a full team in just about every possible manner (and even the Companion perk allows you to simply ignore a handful of creatures when it comes to the perk benefits).

Since Druid's perks apply to pretty much everything, almost any creature can be used with it, though you often lose the benefit of team-based synergies in return, however Companion can mitigate this to a degree.

Druid anointments can be obtained by defeating Imp Impington Prime.
Tribalist

Strength in numbers. Tribalists prefer to use creatures that belong to the same race or class, and take full advantage of the synergy and camaraderie they offer each other.

As a Tribalist, you'll want to assemble a party of creatures that belong to the same race. This will provide them with significant benefits that are exacerbated by their racial synergies with each other.

This is an Advanced specialization and as such cannot be chosen at the beginning, nor does it get a starter creature.

Bleeding (Waspid Slicer)
Creatures with Bleeding take damage equal to 30% of their current Health at the start of each turn. Creatures that are resistant to Bleeding take 66% less damage from this debuff.

Notes
Tribalists like to use creatures of the same race with each other - since creatures within a given race tend to have rather similar abilities to one another, this can often create teams that have a lot of raw power but a somewhat narrow tactical scope.

Where Tribalist really shines however is with particular races of creature that already self-synergize, such as Familiars or Hunters. In these cases, Forest Pact amplifies their already powerful synergies even further. Beyond this, most of Tribalist's perks will work for any team so long as you stick to using one race and class, so look around and find out what works well for you with them.

Tribalist anointments can be obtained by defeating Imp Impington Prime.
Trickster

Luck is not merely a matter of chance, but instead a force that can be manipulated to a clever man's will. Tricksters capitalize on this fact, enabling their creatures to re-roll the proverbial dice whenever fate doesn't turn out quite they way they hoped.

As a Trickster, you'll heavily inconvenience enemies by preventing them from taking action. You'll also gain the ability to manipulate the element of luck - for example, if a positive effect has a chance to activate but fails to do so, you can try again.

This is an Advanced specialization and as such cannot be chosen at the beginning, nor does it get a starter creature.

Notes
Tricksters do a wide range of things, among them manipulating probability, strengthening artifacts, and weakening enemies - with the overall aim of tipping the odds in your favor.

Intent to Kill, Rebound, and Sleight of Hand all essentially mitigate poor luck by just trying again if things don't turn out in your favor, so you'll likely see favorable outcomes more often and you'll be more able to rely on chance than other specializations - whereas perks like Pilfer or Even the Odds just directly weaken the enemy in your favor.

Trickster anointments can be obtained by defeating Caliban the Unredeemed.
Astrologer

Astrologers are magi who specialize in creating a sound strategy before each battle. Oftentimes, their plans are so well-constructed that their creatures are able to take combat into their own hands without any further input from their master.

As an Astrologer, you'll plan most of your battle strategies before combat even begins. Astrologers allow their creatures to act on their own under certain conditions.

This is an Advanced specialization and as such cannot be chosen at the beginning, nor does it get a starter creature.

Protostar (ASCENSION)
Ranks: 1
Cost Per Rank: 1
Anointment: No
If your creatures have been killed in the current battle, they deal 90% more damage and take 60% less damage.

Notes
This is a very complicated specialization that requires a carefully planned team to take full advantage of. It essentially predefines roles based on your creatures' stats; the three with the highest intelligence have strong casting advantages, the highest attack creatures will attack automatically, the one with the highest speed will always counter attacks, and the one with the highest defense will provoke to automatically act as a tank, so you will want a statistically mixed team rather than going all-in on one strategy.

Consider which specialization role each creature will end up in based on their stats, and try to choose traits that synergize with that - on-provoke traits for the tank, attacking and casting traits for the creatures with the highest stat in each. Also keep in mind that there are general purpose traits such as defending when they have debuffs, and gaining stats at the start of each creature's turn, so its not all about slotting each creature into a meticulous role.

Astrologer anointments can be obtained by defeating Hydranox.
Doombringer

The Doombringer draws magic from the Bastion of the Void to fuel his creatures with vast amounts of power. Doombringers specialize in allowing their creatures to perform actions multiple times in a row, all while nullifying his enemies' efforts.

As a Doombringer, your creatures' on-action effects (on-attack, on-cast, etc) can activate additional times, allowing you to chain brutal combos together to devastate your enemies. Doombringers are also able to prevent enemies' on-action effects from occurring as a defensive measure, as well.

Juggernaut (ASCENSION)
Ranks: 1
Cost Per Rank: 1
Anointment: No
Your creatures deal 5% more damage for each time their on-action effects activated in the current battle.

Notes
Doombringers are an interesting class in that it offers several options where rather than building your creatures' traits around your perk set, they simply power up whatever traits you are already using by doubling the effects and the value of those effects. However, there are diverse options that will allow you to use creatures in unintended ways by making healing, attacking and defending act as triggers for death, resurrection and provocation traits at the same time without actually performing those actions.

Doombringer anointments can be obtained by defeating Hydranox.
Grovetender

Grovetenders take great pride in their Herbling companions, strongly preferring to focus the bulk of their efforts on this prized creature over all the others. This peculiar mage knows just the right techniques to bring out her Herbling's full potential as it transforms rapidly in combat to wreak havoc on its foes.

As a Grovetender, you will always have a unique creature in your party called an Herbling. During battle, your creatures' actions will fertilize the Herbling, causing it to rapidly evolve until it turns into an unstoppable force of nature.

Notes
Similar to the Animator, the Grovetender's perks revolve around the Herbling, a creature given you to you for free when you complete the project to unlock it. Your core perk is Photosynthesis, which should be unlocked first before the others - this will allow your Herbling to evolve in battle, strongly empowering the other perks.

The Herbling can grow more powerful in its own right through perks like Biodegradation and Synthetic Resin, as well act acting as a guardian to your other creatures through perks like Acclimatization and Eternal Blossom. Deep Roots allows you a degree of flexibility in what role the Herbling will play - tanking with Provoke in the first slot, or protecting itself in the sixth slot.

Notably, each perk that grants it free spell casts all involve Nature-class spells, so any traits that enhance Nature casts, such as Imp traits, may come in very handy on your team.

Grovetender has no anointments that can be equipped by other specializations.

Supplemental Info
Spells
Murder of Crows (Misery)
Random enemies take a moderate amoutn of damage 3 times, plus 2 more times for each dead creature on the battlefield.

Notes
Purgatorians are a very high-risk, high reward class that thrive on their creatures dying or being dead. While your dead creatures can still act on your behalf and more strongly than they would while alive, and are effectively beyond retaliation, they still act randomly which gives you less ability to focus down priority targets.

In addition, creatures being dead will increase the risk and enemy focus on your living creatures - while Designated Survivor and Masochism can blunt this, you should still prepare your team build very carefully to allow your final creature to stay standing.

There are a handful of existing traits that allow creatures to act while dead that could synergize with this specialization - in addition, revival-oriented creatures such as Wights and Phoenixes may be of high value to a Purgatorian looking for perk synergies.

Purgatorian anointments can be obtained by defeating The Ancestor.

Spells
Rune of Lua (Aegis, Rune of Lua)
Target takes a large amount of damage, caster recovers Health equal to 50% of the damage dealt, and the caster's on-attack effects are activated. 100% of this spell's damage is based on the caster's highest stat.

Rune of Cor (Aggression, Rune of Cor)
Target takes a large amount of damage, loses a moderate amount of a random stat, and the caster's on-attack effects are activated. 100% of this spell's damage is based on the caster's highest stat.

Rune of Dun (Crescendo, Rune of Dun)
Target takes a large amount of damage, caster gains a random minion, and the caster's on-attack effects are activated. 100% of this spell's damage is based on the caster's highest stat.

Rune of Nax (Destiny, Rune of Nax)
Target takes a large amount of damage, caster gains a moderate amount of a random stat, and the caster's on-attack effects are activated. 100% of this spell's damage is based on the caster's highest stat.

Rune of Sah (Embiggen, Rune of Sah)
Target takes a large amount of damage and its buffs and minions are removed, caster's debuffs are removed, and the caster's on-attack effects are activated. 100% of this spell's damage is based on the caster's highest stat.

Status Effects
Silenced (Diabolism)
Creatures with Silenced cannot cast spells. Overwrites Scorned. Creatures that are resistant to Silenced can still cast spells, but deal 50% less damage with spells.

Notes
Rune Knights are highly flexible, able to modify their bonuses within each battle depending on which Rune Spells they cast - for instance, a team full of Nature creatures casting Nax will amplify their dodge and critical chance, whereas Life creatures casting Lua will become tankier and harder to kill. Obviously the Rune perks that confer these spells are critical to your perk set, so activate them first depending on which creatures you're using.

In addition, generalist enhancements are available such as Discharge and Empowerment, but everything hinges around casting Rune spells as much as possible - the only perk that does not revolve around doing this is Diabolism's silence immunity. Also, since the Rune spells activate on-attack effects despite being a spell cast, it may be worth finding some traits that use these effects to get even more power out of them.

A small handy tip - if you're struggling to remember which Rune is which, each one starts with the same letter as the class it's from. Life is Lua, Chaos is Cor, and so forth.

Rune Knight anointments can be obtained by defeating Lost Construct.

Your creatures gain a large amount of stats, plus 50% more stats for each Nature Infusion you have.

Sorcery Variant:
Your creatures Cast one of their spells, plus 1 additional spell for each Sorcery Infusion you have.

Notes
Spellweavers are a complicated class that make their spells gain gradually more powerful additional effects the more they cast them, as well as having exclusive access to the powerful Colorwave spell. Since Colorwave requires 1 of each infusion as "ammo", you will want a diverse range of spells to cast, preferably one of each type across your team. Your key perks are the Infusion perks as well as Ultimate Manifestation, so be sure to unlock those first if you intend to make use of those infusions.

Infusions increase the power of the additional effect each spell gains from your perks, as well as making your creatures stronger in general. In this regard the specialization is similar to Rune Knight, but gains power from all spells rather than specific ones. Spellweavers would gain a lot of mileage out of casting several times per turn, allowing them to stack up infusions more quickly - but of course, keep an eye on your charges if you intend to do that!

Spellweaver anointments can be obtained by defeating Hydranox, however there are very few available.

Status Effects
Inverted (Antipode, Antithesis, Contrarian, Damned Visions, Delusion of Grandeur, Edge of Reality, Eternal Dream, Late Confessions, Lost in the Echo, Unfurling Nightmare)

Blighted (Losing Touch)
Creatures with Blighted cannot be healed and take damage from healing effects equal to 25% of the effect.

Notes
With unique access to the Inverted debuff, you will be heavily reliant on maintaining and applying the debuff for your leverage. Thankfully it functions as a defense mechanism by causing enemies to heal you instead of doing damage, and you can leverage your Paradox perk to trigger your creatures' on-heal effects for additional trickery.

In addition, perks such as Counterintuitive, Hallucination and Question Everything invert negative effects into positive ones if you apply them to your own team, causing certain spells and traits to get new tactical leverage they did not have before.

Dreamshade anointments can be obtained by defeating Mindwurm.

As a Siegemaster, you'll protect your creatures with powerful defensive mechanisms while they reflect damage taken back on their attackers. This specialization makes great use of the Defend command in battle.

Confused creatures have a 50% chance to attack or cast harmful spells on their allies.

Notes
Though primarily a solid defensive bulwark, Siegemasters are able to use their defensive power as an attack angle using perks like Explosive Armor, The Best Offense and Thorns. You will obviously want to stack as much defense as you possibly can as most of your perk set runs off it - though take note of perks such as Armor Shred and Titanic Rage that allow you an advantage against enemies.

Siegemaster anointments can be obtained by defeating Lost Construct.

Supplemental Info
Status Effects
Disarmed (Quick Hands)
Disarmed creatures lose the benefits from their equipped Artifact, other than Health.

Notes
Windrunners rely on stacking as much speed as possible, and leveraging it in battle to stay alive long enough for the effects of perks such as Accumulation and Derivation to cascade the battle in their favor. Curiously, their perkset has relatively little in the way of offensive options and is almost all about gaining or preserving speed, so you will have to leverage your creatures' traits much more than with other specializations to get the most out of Windrunner.

Windrunner anointments can be obtained by defeating Imp Impington Prime.
Fanatic

Fanatics devote their lives to serving the gods. From dusk until dawn, these magi toil away at a neverending list of demands to better-serve each of the 21 gods of Rodia.

As a Fanatic, you'll be able to take additional Avatar creatures with you on your journey and empower them and their Ultimate Spell Gems with potent magic. Fanatics also make use of Godspawn creatures and create powerful synergies between them and their Avatar allies.

NOTE: Fanatic is special even among non-starter specializations, as it requires you to obtain an Avatar creature and bring it to Everett when attempting to start the project to unlock it.

Notes
Fanatics are a true endgame class, since they hinge around the use of creatures that are only available some time after finishing the game's storyline. You will want a party comprised entirely of these creatures, since the specialization does not offer any kind of bonus to any other type of creature.

Since Avatars tend to have very powerful traits but you are only limited to one per party, Army of Gods' ability to bring three with you is absurdly strong - and you can get more within battle through use of the Martyr perk. Try to remember which Godspawn corresponds to which Avatar - the god you purchase it from is the Avatar you will invoke through "respective Avatar" perks. It may be better to not use an Avatar AND their respective Godspawn in a single party composition if you plan to make use of Martyr, as Avatar traits tend not to stack. Otherworldly and Unstoppable Force will also prevent your Ultimate Spells from being shut down or blocked by Silence and Seal, but bear in mind that other factors may prevent the casting of these spells.

Fanatic anointments can be obtained by defeating Saint Althea.
Toxicologist

Toxicologists spend their days tarrying away at all manner of potions and elixirs that might serve their use in battle. These mad scientists care little for the well-being of their own creatures, equipping them with venomous toxins that grant them enhanced combat prowess at the cost of their own lives.

As a Toxicologist, you'll use the Poison debuff to inflict massive damage over time to your foes. You'll also Poison your own creatures to generate beneficial effects when they take damage.

This is an Advanced specialization and as such cannot be chosen at the beginning, nor does it get a starter creature.

Perks

Cost Per Rank: 20
Anointment: Yes

Virus (Dispersing Plague)
Enemies take damage equal to 2 turns of their Poisoned debuff.

Status Effects
Poisoned (All Perks except Plague of Toads)
Creatures with Poisoned take damage based on the inflictor's Attack each turn.

Notes
Toxicologist is to Poison what Pyromancer is to Burning. The entire perk set revolves around taking advantage of this classic status effect, with Carcinogen and Diagnosis ensuring everyone on the battlefield is poisoned at all times, and perks such as Addictive Effect and Dispersing Plague turning it from a liability into a dangerous but effective advantage for your own team.

Toxicologist's perk set carries a fair amount of risk to your own creatures, so have a plan to ensure they remain healed and do not themselves die to the constant damage they'll be taking from their own poison.
Shadowbringer

The presence of a Shadowbringer spells doom for all who cross its path. This ethereal being bends the light into darkness, sapping its foes' will to live from their hearts.

As a Shadowbringer, you'll utilize the Blighted debuff to damage your foes using numerous healing effects.

Ranks: 1
Cost Per Rank: 1
Anointment: No

Creatures with Leeching recover Health equal to 25% of the damage they deal.

Mending (Shadow Mending, Self-fulfilling Prophecy)
Creatures with Mending recover 25% Health at the start of their turn.

Notes
Killing them with kindness, the Shadowbringer is a spec that loves to heal enemies to death. The constant presence of Blight via Shadow Sickness will ensure that enemies cannot receive any healing (though do note it does not block resurrection outside of Endwalker's effect), and Worldbreaker amps up its usually middling damage to much better levels.

Most of the rest of the perk set revolves around making enemies just constantly keep getting hurt by further sources of healing, such as Touch of Darkness. Do note that Shadowbringer is rather light on defensive perks, so it may be a good idea to ensure your creatures have a solid plan to protect themselves in place.
Engineer

The Engineer's sole purpose in life is to build a bigger and better explosive than last time. This bombastic bombardier belays bombs to its opponent's backs, blasting them back to the bilgewater from whence they were born.

As an Engineer, you'll strap bombs to enemies and blow them to bits. The Engineer is also accompanied by their greatest invention: the Microbot minion!

This is an Advanced specialization and as such cannot be chosen at the beginning, nor does it get a starter creature.

Ranks: 1
Cost Per Rank: 100
Anointment: Yes

Renewable Armaments
Ranks: 1

Status Effects

Microbots (Drone Bait)
At the end of this minion's master's turn, each Microbots deals damage to a random enemy equal to 50% of its Intelligence. Maximum of 9 stacks.

Notes
Like Pyromancer, Toxicologist and Shadowbringer, Engineer goes all-in on a single status effect - that being Bomb. Do note that the only perk in this set that actually afflicts Bomb consistently is Primed and Ready, and only at the start of battle, so you will need to bring along something that actually afflicts additional Bombs, such as the Fireworks spell - note that Energy Efficient will make these spells be cost-free to cast, so you can go all-in on them in battle without too much worry.

Once you get the bombs rolling, Engineer's perkset snowballs rather quickly with perks like Extrusion causing the bombs to quickly escalate in damage, and Prototype having the bombs run off your highest stat, which will allow you to stat-stack to ensure they're doing as much damage as possible.
Brewmaster

The Brewmaster believes that no problem can't be solved with a full mug of beer... or six. This unexpected hero generously distributes all manner of ales and cocktails to friend and foe alike - but all should be wary when the time comes to pay the bill.

Drunken Camaraderie (ASCENSION)
Ranks: 1
Cost Per Rank: 1
Anointment: No
Enemies take a moderate amount of damage and your creatures are healed for a moderate amount when they are affected by your creatures' Booze spells.

Notes
Booze spells, which are available to purchase from the Gambling Dwarves' shop, are usually powerful spells which can't be cast manually and only have a chance to go off at the end of a creature's turn - Brewmasters have the option to cast them manually (Brewmaster's Handshake), make them impervious to sealing (Straight Up) AND not consume charges (On The House). While these effects are powerful in and of themselves, perks like Inebriation and Numb the Pain also grant a Brewmaster absurd defensive power as long as they're able to stay in the fight and spam their booze spells as much as possible.

Throw in the standard-issue snowball perks like Liquid Courage and the fact that Booze spells are strong to begin with AND will still be automatically triggering as they usually would, and you have yourself a truly fearsome specialization in the right hands.
Demonologist

Lucifer (Summon Lucifer)
At the start of Lucifer's master's turn, it Attacks random enemies 3 times.

Notes
A very unique specialization, Demonologist has exclusive access to Lesser and Greater Demons, though Renounce the Light does make you pay the price of eschewing buffs and regular minions in order to get this access.

Demonologists favor a class-diverse team that features at least one of every class, else they will not be able to get access to Satanachia, and if ascended, Lucifer. Otherwise, the Greater Demons offer a significant power boost - Asmodeus and Belphegor offer drastic offensive benefits for attackers and casters respectively, Beelzebub and Leviathan synergize with the rest of the perk set, and Mammon is a strong defensive presence since the Protected buff is not available.

On top of this, your Lesser Demons in and of themselves supplement your attacks and casts, and turn defending/provoking into an offensive option - but that's not all, since Demonologist's perk set makes the sacrificing of these minions grant you lasting empowerment through perks such as Inner Demons and Soul Shield, so you shouldn't try to hold onto your Lesser Demons for too long - use them up and grow stronger, since you can always get more!
Gladiator

The Gladiator is a master of the arena, sporting tremendous proficiency with all manner of weapons. No sword, no axe, no bow is too difficult for this master of armaments to wield.

As a Gladiator, you'll utilize powerful Arsenal spells to bolster your forces and devastate your opponents. In addition, your creatues' Artifacts will become far stronger than normal.

This is an Advanced specialization and as such cannot be chosen at the beginning, nor does it get a starter creature.

Status Effects
Disarmed (Grip of the Gods)

Notes
It may take a bit of grinding out the Arena's rewards to get a solid plan for this specialization rolling, as unlocking the Living Artifact spells that are sold there may take quite a bit - though you can use Reprimand or Crowd Favorite to get random arsenal spells if you don't have them yet, so this specialization isn't a dead end if you haven't gotten around to it.

Besides this, another factor you'll want is making sure your castle's Blacksmith is fully upgraded, since the higher level an artifact is upgraded to, the more benefit it will get from Gladiator's slot-enhancing perks such as Elbow Grease, Nether Imbuement and Blacksmith's Boon.

Do be cautious to note that Gladiator features no anti-seal or anti-silence mechanisms in its perk set, so you may want to shore up your defenses by finding ways around these in order to ensure you stay at maximum flexibility and strength in battle. Reprimand could potentially be used to get around sealing, but only if you have ethereal spells available.
Graveborn

The Graveborn is a once-powerful warlock who was killed for his heresy and has since risen from the dead to wreak havoc on the living. This undead spellcaster is capable of bringing his creatures back from the dead with far greater power than before.

As a Graveborn, you'll bring empowered versions of your creatures back from the dead to wreak havoc on your enemies.

This is an Advanced specialization and as such cannot be chosen at the beginning, nor does it get a starter creature.

From Beyond the Grave (ASCENSION)

Status Effects
Immune (Unnatural Causes)
Creatures with Immune can't be afflicted with debuffs.

Notes
Graveborn should not be confused with Purgatorian despite the similar tone of the two - Graveborn is all about coming back stronger each time. Care should be taken to eliminate enemy traits that prey upon your creatures dying however, or you will find your main advantage rapidly turning into a liability since you only get three resurrections per creature.

This is a higher risk specialization since you may opt to let your creatures a few times to get them up to full power - once they're on their last life, they will boast doubled stats, debuff immunity and significant bonuses to dealing out more damage and taking less - but if they go down anyway, they stay down. Use traits that synergize with resurrections to push your advantages even further.
Mime

While the Mime's own combat prowess leaves much to be desired, it excels at copying it's opponent's actions, turning its enemies' strategy against them to assure victory.

As a Mime, you'll enable your creatures to copy the actions of your opponents and grow stronger based on how your enemies behave in battle.

This is an Advanced specialization and as such cannot be chosen at the beginning, nor does it get a starter creature.

After an enemy attacks, it has a 25% chance to be afflicted with Blind.

Blind (Bewilderment)
Blind creatures cannot choose their targets when attacking or casting single-target spells.

Confused (Mock)
Confused creatures have a 50% chance to attack or cast harmful spells on their allies.

Notes
Mimes are a tricky beast, since enemy team compositions are unpredictable and you can't ever really count on an enemy having particular things in their lineup or taking particular actions. However, Mime's perk set covers just about every action enemies may take, allowing you to set up counter-reactions through various trait combos to take advantage of just about anything an enemy might do, with Stationary Walk and The Lean in particular allowing you to gradually grow in power as battle wears on.

There is also nothing stopping you from manipulating the enemy into taking particular actions to get the reaction you want either, so long as you have the right traits and spells on hand.
Deprived

The Deprived was born with nothing and will die with nothing. Cursed with the intelligence of a sponge and the physique of a sickly child, the Deprived must make do with what little fate has left him with.

As a Deprived, you'll lose access to your most significant sources of power, including Fused traits, Avatar creatures, and Relic effects. This is a Challenge Specialization, and it will not appear at the Goblet of Giving after you unlock it.

This is an Advanced specialization and as such cannot be chosen at the beginning, nor does it get a starter creature. It is also a Challenge Specialization, meaning it makes you weaker rather than stronger.

Perks
Total Deprivation
Ranks: 1
Cost Per Rank: 1
Anointment: Yes
Your creatures' Fused traits are ignored. You cannot use Avatar creatures. Your creatures' Relic effects are ignored. This perk is always active while your specialization is Deprived, even if you haven't allocated any Perk Points to it.

Simple Life (ASCENSION)
Ranks: 1
Cost Per Rank: 1
Anointment: No
You have a 100% increased chance to find Skins. This perk is always active, even if your specialization is not Deprived.

Notes
This specialization is intended as a challenge, particularly for Ascension - facing down all the gods without fusion traits, avatars or relics is intended to get you to rack your brain and think about how to get as much as possible out of the most basic elements of a team.

Don't forget that you can take it to realms outside of the Gate of the Gods, and completing 100 realms with it will unlock achievements and outfits.
Pariah

The Pariah is a social outcast who prefers to spend her days in solitude. Though her friends are few, she is resourceful enough to maintain her indepdendence with some success.

As a Pariah, you'll be forced to fight using a more limited number of creatures than usual. This is a Challenge Specialization, and it will not appear at the Goblet of Giving after you unlock it.

This is an Advanced specialization and as such cannot be chosen at the beginning, nor does it get a starter creature. It is also a Challenge Specialization, meaning it makes you weaker rather than stronger.

Perks
Introversion
Ranks: 1

Anointment: No
You have a 25% increased chance to find Nether Stones. This perk is always active, even if your specialization is not Pariah.

Notes
Another challenge specialization similar to Deprived, this one tests your ability to get the most out of a small team, without powering them up through Druid's small-team advantages.

This specialization is intended as a challenge, particularly for Ascension - facing down all the gods without fusion traits, avatars or relics is intended to get you to rack your brain and think about how to get as much as possible out of the most basic elements of a team.

Don't forget that like Deprived, you can take it to realms outside of the Gate of the Gods, and completing 100 realms with it will unlock achievements and outfits.
Royal

Authority is passed down through generations, but true power must be earned. A master of all professions, the Royal possesses the unique ability to combine the powers of other specializations at will.

As a Royal, you'll be able to use more Anointments than anyone else, allowing you to create your own, custom specialization.

NOTE: Royal is special even among non-starter specializations, as it requires you to unlock all other specializations before you can start the project to unlock it.

Perks
Master of All
Ranks: 1

Anointment: No
You can equip 10 additional Anointments.

Highborn (ASCENSION)
Ranks: 1
Cost Per Rank: 1
Anointment: No

Notes
This specialization has no perks of its own, instead using the Anointments system to choose up to 15 perks from every other specialization as you see fit, essentially making it the ultimate custom hybrid specialization.

Royal offers an unprecedented amount of flexibility, so look through the other specializations' perks and see what kind of combinations you can come up with!

Royal itself has no anointments that can be equipped by other specializations.
