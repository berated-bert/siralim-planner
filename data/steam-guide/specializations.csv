name,abbreviation,description
Hell Knight,HK,"Careful planning and uptight caution are nothing but a cause to doubt oneself. Hell Knights realize this fact, and instead opt to send their creatures charging headlong into battle, relying on brute strength and reckless attacks to ensure a swift victory.
As a Hell Knight, you'll favor creatures that specialize in attacking. Hell Knights grant their creatures increased critical damage and cause a variety of effects to occur when they attack. Hell Knights are surprisingly adept at spellcasting in a pinch, as well."
Reaver,RE,"Perseverance, an iron will, and a touch of insanity are the perfect recipe for victory. Reavers live and die by this mantra, instilling their creatures with a cold and calculated anger that allows them to grow more powerful during battle while their foes tire out.
As a Reaver, your creatures will gain massive benefits in combat as battle continue to drag on. If your creatures manage to survive for just a few extra turns, they'll be able to devastate your enemies."

As a Pyromancer, you'll make heavy use of the Burning debuff to deal damage to enemies over time. In addition, your own creatures will be afflicted with this debuff, but it will heal and empower them rather than dealing damage."

As a Necromancer, you'll summon minions to aid your creatures in battle. These minions can do all kinds of things to support your creatures - they can cause damage, boost your creatures' stats, debuff enemies, and much more."
Defiler,DE,"The difference between good and evil is often a matter of perspective, but the morality of a Defiler is simple enough for anyone to decide.

As a Defiler, you'll specialize in debuffs and stat-reducing effects. Enemies will be so weak that your party will be able to easily pick them off, even if they were originally much more powerful than your creatures."
Animator,AN,"There's a fine line between genius and insanity, and it's difficult to say on what side of that line Animators reside.

Paladin,PA,"Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. Paladins are patient combatants who prefer to allow their enemies to strike first, and then return the favor tenfold with holy fury.

Druid,DR,"Many people foolishly mistake a Druid's introversion for weakness. These magi believe that quality always trumps quantity on the battlefield.
