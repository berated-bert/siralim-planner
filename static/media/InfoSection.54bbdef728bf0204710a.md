## Siralim Planner by Berated Bert

This is a fan-made tool designed to simplify the process of planning builds for [Siralim Ultimate](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289810/Siralim_Ultimate/). As a longtime fan of the series I always wished there was an easy way to theorycraft Siralim builds - so I came up with this tool. The three main features of this tool are outlined below.

### Party Planner

The Party Planner allows you to put together a list of 18 traits for your Siralim Ultimate party. It is comprised of 18 rows, which are separated into 6 groups of 3 - these correspond to your party members, and their 3 traits (2 creature traits, and 1 artifact slot).

To start planning your party, click on one of the 18 rows. This brings up the Trait Selection Window, described below.

You can **drag and drop** traits between rows to swap them - this enables you to easily swap traits between creatures/slots.

The tool also supports some basic **validation**: if you put a trait from a monster that cannot be obtained (i.e. a Nether Boss) into a creature slot, the row will be highlighted with red stripes to let you know that such an assignment is not possible.

### Trait Selection Window

In the trait selection window, you can **search** for a particular keyword, e.g. if you want to find all creatures that interact with buffs in some way you can type "buff" and the results will be filtered accordingly.

You can type "AND" to search for multiple things, e.g. "defend AND nature" returns all nature creatures who have "defend" in the trait.

### Sharing builds

Builds can be easily shared - simply copy the URL and send it to someone and they will be able to load your build.

### Acknowledgements and Source Code

The data was sourced from the [Siralim Ultimate Compendium](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qvWwf1fNB5jN8bJ8dFGAVzC7scgDCoBO-hglwjTT4iY/edit#gid=0), a fantastic resource by EmptyPalms. I'd like to thank EmptyPalms for putting together this resource and for their permission to use the data as part of this tool. I would also like to thank rogermicroger for their excellent [Siralim Ultimate API](https://github.com/rovermicrover/siralim-ultimate-api), from which the creature sprites and stats are obtained. Thanks also to Gay Moth Aunt for compiling all of the specialization info in their excellent [Character Specialization Guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2190265173).

The **source code** of this tool is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/berated-bert/siralim-planner). If you would like to work on it you are more than welcome to submit a pull request or fork the repository.

Depending on usage I may or may not keep the tool up-to-date with the latest version of the Siralim Ultimate Compendium. If it is not up-to-date at some point feel free to download the code yourself and run it locally. Better yet, feel free to update the GitHub repository with the latest spreadsheet and submit a pull request.

If you encounter any problems or have any feedback please feel free to message me on Discord - **BeratedBert#6292**, or submit an issue on the GitHub repo.
