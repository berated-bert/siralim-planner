-   The sources were taken from the Siralim Ultimate API. If you notice anything incorrect, please feel free to tag me on Discord. Even better, submit a pull request to the [Siralim Ultimate API GitHub](https://github.com/rovermicrover/siralim-ultimate-api).

### v1.1.3 (23 July 2022)

-   Added all the missing creature sprites. Big thanks to Orbit49 on Discord who alerted me to the fact that most of the creature sprites were released as part of an avatars pack on the Siralim Ultimate forums ([link](https://forums.thylacinestudios.com/t/siralim-ultimate-forum-avatars-profile-pictures/8271)).
-   Added new specialization icons.

### v1.1.2 (19 July 2022)

-   Fixed small bug with the "MISSING SPRITE" text appearing underneath every creature portrait.

### v1.1.1 (18 July 2022)

-   Made the changelog appear when the version number is clicked, and removed the changelog from the info button.
-   You can now type "AND" in the monster search bar to further refine the results. For example, "defend AND nature" returns all nature creatures who have "defend" in the trait.

### v1.1.0 (18 July 2022)

-   Updated for game version 1.1.0. Note that at the time of writing this, it is still in the test branch so you'll need to opt in to the test beta to play on this version of the game if you haven't already.
-   Please note many of the newer creature sprites are still unavailable, and will be added once they are made available by modders. Same goes for the new specialization sprites.
-   Added "MISSING SPRITE" for creatures currently missing sprites.

### v1.0.4 (28 November 2021)

-   Added Relics into the tool, based on data sourced from the Siralim Ultimate Compendium.
-   Added a reset button.
-   Added a randomise button.

Thank you to EmptyPalms for the suggestions!

### v1.0.3 (22 November 2021)

-   Added data from Siralim Ultimate Compendium v0.12.12.
-   Note that monster sprites and stats for the new creatures are not currently present, and will be added once Siralim Ultimate API is updated.
-   Unfortunately builds from the previous patch are broken - sorry about that. It shouldn't happen in future though unless the trait names, creature names, or family names change again.

### v1.0.2 (1 October 2021)

-   Major design overhaul.
-   Added the ability to select a specialization and anointments.
-   Added monster stats to the monster selection table.
-   The monster selection table can now be sorted by clicking on the headings.

### v1.0.1 (25 September 2021)

-   Tool now allows you to upload your build directly from the export from the game.

### v1.0.0 (24 September 2021)

-   Released.
